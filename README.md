Description
This is suppose to be a simple weather app that shows a five day forecast for any city using the Open Weather Map API.

How it turned out
Well I managed to somehow get my app to display the forecast for 2.5 days for my town only. The temperature for some reason is in Celsious and not Degreees.
When I open the live site, it only shows the name of the app. When I open the dev tools to check the code, it shows completely different code than what I actually have. 
When I open the app through VS Code, my actual code is displayed so not sure what is going on there.
